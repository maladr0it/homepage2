        <p>
          I love making beautiful, responsive web-applications. With
          <strong>three years</strong> in the React.js game, it is my framework
          of choice. I am driven to produce apps that feel natural to use, are
          of high-performance and inspire delight in the user.

          I am an extremely active participant in the web-development community,

            <p>
              A powerful implementation of Flux architecture and my go-to answer

              debugging are the cherry on top.

            <p>
              I work closely with designers and product managers to create rapid
              proof of concept prototypes. These are subject to user-testing,
              live A/B testing and eventually transitioned to stable,

            <em>Front-End Developer and Product Owner</em>
            <p>
              Here I built a one-to-many chat application to handle many
              thousands of customer interactions at Tabiko.ai. It offers a high
              performance UI to manage payments, itineraries and travel-related
              search.

            <p>
              I introduced practices such as Test-Driven-Development and

            <em>Front-End Developer</em>
            <p>
              Here I helped build <em>Dimare</em>, a work-shift management
              software for several restaurant chains in South-East-Asia. I was
              responsible for the UX vision for the product, working alongside
              our clients to identify their use-cases and pain-points.
            </p>
            <p>
              I worked with a team of six developers, learning about advanced
              state management, agile methodology and javascript best-practices
              from my mentor.

            <em>Student Project - Team Leader</em>
            <p>
              As part of a scholarship program, I lead a team of five students
              to develop software to optimize this dairy-plant's operations. We
              used ruby for modeling of the plant, and javascript for report
              generation in a web-based view.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was hired full-time after graduation to continue development of
              the product, which is still used today!

              I worked in project management for construction of new Nike HQ.
              During my time there, I made VBA tools for easier report
              generation.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, the biggest take-away from this job was in learning
              project-management skills which have turned me into an effective
              leader in my future roles.
