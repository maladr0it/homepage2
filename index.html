      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I love making beautiful, responsive web-applications. With <strong>three years</strong> in the React.js game, it is my framework of choice. I am driven to produce apps that feel natural to use, are of high-performance and inspire delight in the user.</p>
      <p>I am an extremely active participant in the web-development community, participating online via <a href="https://www.reactiflux.com/" target="_blank">Reactiflux</a> as well as in local meetups and hackathons.</p>
      <p>An avid traveller, I enjoy travelling the world for inspiration.  My hobbies include calligraphy, rugby and flim critique. I'm currently reading David Foster Wallace's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_Jest" target="_blank"><em>Infinite Jest</em></a>, and am jamming to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jorjasmith" target="_blank">Jorja Smith</a> in my coding sessions.</p>

      <h2>Skills</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>React.js</h3>
          <p>Declarative design, reusable components, the virtual DOM, enough said. An all-around awesome framework that has fundamentally changed my workflow.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Redux</h3>
          <p>A powerful implementation of Flux architecture and my go-to answer to managing state complexity. App persistance and time-travel debugging are the cherry on top.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Firebase</h3>
          <p>Real-time delivery of data with Firebase's <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/">Cloud Firestore</a> has proven extremely useful in my work at <a href="https://tabiko.ai/">tabiko.ai</a>, where many thousands of customer interactions must be observable live as they unfold.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Node.js</h3>
          <p>Event-driven architecture, scalability and most importantly NPM make this my favourite back-end environment.  Both <a href="https://www.fusionsystems.org/">Fusion Systems</a> and <a href="https://tabiko.ai/">tabiko.ai</a>'s high I/O services have proven especially suited to this.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Tabiko.ai - Tokyo</h3>
          <em>Product Owner</em>
          <p>Here I'm building a one-to-many chat application to handle many thousands of customer interactions at Tabiko.ai.  It offers a high performance UI to manage payments, itineraries and travel-related search.</p>
          <p>I have also introduced practices such as Test-Driven-Development and code-reviews to bring the engineering team to new levels of productivity.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Fusion Systems - Tokyo</h3>
          <em>Front-End Developer</em>
          <p>Here I helped build Dimare, a work-shift management software for several restaurant chains in South-East-Asia.  I was responsible for the UX vision for the product, working alongside our clients to identify their use-cases and pain-points.</p>
          <p>I worked with a team of six developers, learning about advanced state management, agile methodology and javascript best-practices from my mentor.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Burra Foods - Australia</h3>
          <em>Student Project - Team Leader</em>
          <p>As part of a scholarship program, I lead a team of five students to develop software to optimize this dairy-plant's operations.  We used ruby for modeling of the plant, and javascript for report generation in a web-based view.</p>
          <p>I was hired full-time after graduation to continue development of the product, which is still used today!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Nike - Shanghai</h3>
          <em>Internship</em>
          <p>I worked in project management for construction of new Nike HQ.  During my time there, I made VBA tools for easier report generation.</p>
          <p>However, the biggest take-away from this job was in learning project-management skills which have turned me into an effective leader in my future roles.</p>
