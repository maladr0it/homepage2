  <h1>Hi, I'm Lochie</h1>
  <p>I'm a front-end developer who strives to unlock the full potential of UI.</p>

    <h2>Me</h2>
    <p>I love making beautiful, responsive web-applications. With <b>three years</b> in the React.js game, it is my framework of choice. I am driven to produce apps that feel natural to use, are of high-performance and inspire delight in the user.</p>
    <p>I am an extremely active participant in the web-development community, participating online via <a href="#">Reactiflux</a> as well as in local meetups and hackathons.</p>
    <p>An avid traveller, I enjoy travelling the world for inspiration.  My hobbies include calligraphy, rugby and flim critique. I'm currently reading David Foster Wallace's <a href="#"><i>Infinite Jest</i></a>, and am jamming to <a href="#">Jorja Smith</a> in my coding sessions.</p>

    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>React.js</h3>
        <p>Declarative design, reusable components, the virtual DOM, enough said. An all-around awesome framework that has fundamentally changed my workflow.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Redux</h3>
        <p>A powerful implementation of Flux architecture and my go-to answer to managing state complexity. App persistance and time-travel debugging are the cherry on top.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Firebase</h3>
        <p>Real-time delivery of data with Firebase's <a href="#">Cloud Firestore</a> has proven extremely useful in my work at <a href="#">tabiko.ai</a>, where many thousands of customer interactions must be observable live as they unfold.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Node.js</h3>
        <p>Event-driven architecture, scalability and most importantly NPM make this my favourite back-end environment.  Both <a href="#">Fusion Systems</a> and <a href="#">tabiko.ai</a>'s high I/O services have proven especially suited to this.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>So far I have brought two products to production at <a href="#">Fusion Systems</a> and <a href="#">tabiko.ai</a>. During this time, I have introduced practices such as Test-Driven-Development and code-reviews to bring my team to new levels of productivity.</p>
    <p>For more information, please see my <a href="#">resume</a>.</p>
